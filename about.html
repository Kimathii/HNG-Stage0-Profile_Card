    <h3>BIO üéì</h3>
    <p>Hey there! I‚Äôm a learning frontend developer who‚Äôs currently knee-deep in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and honestly loving (mostly fighting) every bit of it. I spend most of my time turning random ideas into web pages that actually work, learning React along the way, and trying to make things look good. I have a habit of taking on tasks clearly bigger than me, but that‚Äôs kind of the fun part; figuring it out as I go and watching myself level up one project at a time.</p>

    <h3>GOALS IN THIS PROGRAM‚öΩ</h3>
    <p>First and foremost, I hope to learn as much as possible throughout the HNG program, especially in areas that will strengthen my technical and problem-solving skills. I want to gain a deeper understanding of real-world project development, improve my collaboration abilities, and learn how to write cleaner, more efficient code. Beyond the technical side, I also hope to grow in consistency, discipline, and adaptability; qualities that are essential for success in any tech career. Connecting with other talented participants, mentors, and professionals is another important goal for me, as I believe that strong networks often lead to greater opportunities and shared growth. Ultimately, I want to come out of the HNG program not only as a better developer but also as a more confident and connected individual ready to take on bigger challenges.</p>

    <h3>NOTE TO FUTURE SELF ‚úçüèæ</h3>
    <p>We go eventually dey alright. Not today tho. Today might still feel like confusion mixed with pressure and small doubt, but it‚Äôs all part of the process. You‚Äôre learning, growing, and pushing through things that once looked impossible. The stress and late nights won‚Äôt be forever; one day you‚Äôll look back and realize this was the season that built your strength and sharpened your skill. Keep your head up, keep building, keep connecting with the right people. You no dey do all this for nothing (hopefully*) every small progress counts. Just breathe, trust the process, and remember: 

Anytime wey person wake up, na him morning be that.</p>

    <h3>EXTRA THOUGHTS üí≠</h3>
    <p>Only Stage One, and I‚Äôve already used everything I know lol. But maybe that‚Äôs the whole point; to stretch beyond what I thought I was capable of. It‚Äôs crazy how much HNG can pull out of you, making you dig deeper, think sharper, and create smarter. Still, it‚Äôs kind of exciting too, this feeling of being pushed past comfort. Maybe it‚Äôs not about knowing everything right now, but about growing fast enough to handle what‚Äôs next. One stage down, lessons learned, confidence tested. We move, because somehow, even when it feels like I‚Äôve hit my limit, I always find a little more in me to give.</p>
